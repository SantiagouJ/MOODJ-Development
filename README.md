## 1. Introduction
Welcome to MOODJ's code of conduct, to ensure that our collaboration is productive and we don't accidentally push everything to main 😟, all devs must adhere to the following rules

## 2. Commit Conventions
We need a clear commit history, so follow these simple rules: 😮

- **feat:** Adding a new feature
- **fix:** Fixing a bug
- **docs:** Updating documentation
- **style:** Formatting or style changes (no code changes)
- **refactor:** Code improvements without changing behavior
- **test:** Adding or updating tests
- **chore:** Maintenance tasks (e.g., dependency updates)

### For example
```
feat: added the avatar picker
```

## 3. Branching Model
We use the **Gitflow** workflow to manage branches ! :3

- `main` - Final product
- `develop` - Main development branch
- `feature/{feature-name}` - New features or enhancements
- `bugfix/{issue-number}` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/{issue-number}` - Critical production fixes
- `release/{version}` - Pre-release branch for testing

### Guidelines:
- Always branch from `develop` for new features or bug fixes.
- Create a pull request before merging changes.
- Use descriptive branch names. 👍

## 4. Technologies and Libraries 🤖

These are the libraries that we use hehehehe

### We use: 🎂
- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Linting:** ESLint, TypeScript-ESLint, Globals
- **Package Manager:** npm
- **Module Bundler:** Webpack, Webpack CLI, Webpack Dev Server
- **Tools:** Husky, TS-Loader

## Behavior:
- **humor:** its ok to make fun of each other because it ensures great teamwork
- **communication** please communicate your thoughts and ideas to the team!
- **warning** terri solo git pull 🙏
  
## 6. Consequences
If you do not follow these rules bad things will happen

Thank you MOODJ team, we can do it! 🍰🌠
